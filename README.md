# Weather App v2 Built With React

Welcome to **Weather App v2**, the second version of my weather application, now rebuilt using **React** and **Tailwind CSS** for a modern, scalable, and responsive user experience. This new version improves upon the previous one that was built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

> ðŸ”— **Live Demo:** (https://weather-app-v2-react.vercel.app/)

## Overview

Weather App v2 provides current weather details plus a **3-hour interval hourly forecast** for the day, offering a more comprehensive weather insight.

Features include:

- Current weather conditions by city  
- Hourly forecast every 3 hours for the entire day  
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS  
- Unit testing with Bun  

All weather data is still powered by the familiar [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), the same API used in the previous version.
